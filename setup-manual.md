## Verification

After installing the required tools, verify their installations by running the following commands in the terminal (Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows):

```bash
java -version
python3 --version
pip --version
node -v
npm -v
mysql --version
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during installation or verification, follow the steps below to resolve common problems.

### Java Issues
- **Problem**: `java -version` not recognized.
  - **Solution**: Ensure the JDK `bin` directory is added to the PATH:
    - **Windows**: Add `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17\bin` to the PATH variable.
    - **Linux**: Add `export PATH=$PATH:/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk/bin` to `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`, then run `source ~/.bashrc`.

### Python Issues
- **Problem**: `python3 --version` not recognized.
  - **Solution**:
    - On **Windows**, ensure Python is added to PATH during installation.
    - On **Linux**, confirm installation with `sudo apt install python3`.

### Pip Issues
- **Problem**: `pip` command not found.
  - **Solution**:
    - Run `python3 -m ensurepip --upgrade` to install pip.

### Node.js or npm Issues
- **Problem**: `node` or `npm` commands not recognized.
  - **Solution**:
    - **Windows**: Reinstall Node.js and ensure "Add to PATH" is checked during setup.
    - **Linux**: Install using Node Version Manager (NVM) for better version management:
      ```bash
      curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash
      source ~/.bashrc
      nvm install 21
      ```

### MySQL Issues
- **Problem**: Unable to start MySQL service.
  - **Solution**:
    - On **Linux**, check the service status:
      ```bash
      sudo systemctl status mysql
      ```
      If not active, start it:
      ```bash
      sudo systemctl start mysql
      ```

- **Problem**: Access denied for root user.
  - **Solution**:
    - Run the secure installation script to reset credentials:
      ```bash
      sudo mysql_secure_installation
      ```

### PATH Issues
- **Problem**: Commands not recognized globally.
  - **Solution**:
    - Verify that the tool's `bin` directory is added to the PATH.
    - Restart your terminal or system after updating PATH.

### IDE Issues
- **Problem**: IDE unable to detect installed tools.
  - **Solution**:
    - Check IDE settings for configured tool paths:
      - For PyCharm: Go to **File > Settings > Project > Python Interpreter**.
      - For IntelliJ IDEA: Go to **File > Project Structure > SDKs** and add the correct JDK.

## Additional Help
- Visit the official documentation or community forums for each tool:
  - [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/)
  - [Python](https://www.python.org/)
  - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
  - [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/)

If the problem persists, consider reinstalling the tool or consulting with a development community for advanced troubleshooting.

## Development Enviroment Configuration

### 1. Database
- Open MySQL Workbench.
- Set up a local connection on port 3306.
- Create a database named "_hardwaretechdb_".

### 2. BACKEND
- Clone the [backend-api-REST](https://github.com/Azenith-Solutions/backend-api-rest) repository. 
- Create a .env.development file in the same directory as .env.production.
- Use the provided [.env.example](https://github.com/Azenith-Solutions/documentation-START-HERE/blob/main/.env.example) as a reference to configure database credentials, JWT secret, and Brevo API key in .env.development.
- Run the backend server.
- **Note:** Verify in MySQL Workbench whether the tables have been successfully created â€” JPA should generate them automatically from the model definitions.

### 3. ETL Process
- Clone the [excelDB_loader](https://github.com/Azenith-Solutions/extract-transform-load-script) repository.
- Make sure Python 3 is installed on your machine.
- Also ensure that PIP is up to date.
- Create a .env file in the root directory.
- Use the provided [.env.example](https://github.com/Azenith-Solutions/documentation-START-HERE/blob/main/.env.example) as a reference to configure database credentials and the environment in .env file.
- **Windows:**
  - Switch to the _windows_ branch.
  - Install the dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
  - Run the ETL process:
```bash
python main.py
```
- **Linux:**
  - Switch to the _main_ branch.
- **Note:** Check in MySQL if the data have been inserted correctly.

### 4. FRONTEND
- Install the dependencies:
```bash
npm i
```
- Run the frontend using Vite command:
```bash
npm run dev
```
- **Note:** If an error occurs, delete package-lock.json and the node_modules folder, then reinstall the dependencies
